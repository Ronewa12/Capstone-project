# Capstone-Project 
Problem Statement:

Despite extensive investigations of the genetic mechanism of Schizophrenia, there
has not been a clear indication of the known underlying genetic mechanism of
schizophrenia in the general population worldwide. Even though some studies
suggest an underlying gene expression disturbance in many genes, the underlying
genetic mechanism of schizophrenia is still poorly understood.

Abstract : 

This study performed a secondary analysis of the publicly available RNA-sequence
data from individuals with schizophrenia and individuals who were not affected
aiming to identify main genes that play potential roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia since the underlying genetic mechanism of SCZ are still unknown or poorly
understood.This study introduces SCZ, RNA-sequence and differential gene expression (DGE) including the aim, objectives, methods, as well as the significant
expressed genes we got, and potential challenges. It presents the nf-rnaSeqCount
pipeline that can be access from (https://github.com/phelelani/nf-rnaSeqCount)
and the workflow of obtaining the read counts relating to SCZ of African descent.
Number of key features, such as, test for differential expression and normalization of counts were outlined in how the GE analysis was achieved by utilizing
DESeq2 and the RNA-seq data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (https:
//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
